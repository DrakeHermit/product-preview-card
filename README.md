## My process

- Write the HTML markup
- Add CSS styling
- Make it responsive by adding a media query

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned to work with CSS even better, even if there were hurdles I needed to overcome to where I was headed. Other than that this challenge was pretty straight forward and didn't take me that long to finish.

### Continued development

I need to work on making websites more responsive since I still lack a good understanding of how to actually build out the sites without way too many issues arising. But I'll get there eventually. Everyday I learn something new that help me out tremendously.
